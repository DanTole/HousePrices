# HousePrices

This project uses a dataset of residential sales in Amex, Iowa from 2006 - 2010 and implements linear and machine learning models.

The final versions of the models are stored in the directory 'QA'.  The results from these models were written to the directory 'results'.

A presentation summarising the analysis and results can be found <a href='https://slides.com/simondyates/ames-housing-data#/'>here</a>.  Detailed discussion of the technical approaches used is available in 'Ames Technical Appendix.docx'.
