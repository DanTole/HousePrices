## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
df = read.csv("../Dan/train_cleaned.csv")
dft = read.csv("../Dan/test_cleaned.csv")
```

```{r}
df$SalePrice




```

```{r}
df$MasVnrArea[is.na(df$MasVnrArea)] = 0
df$GarageYrBlt[is.na(df$GarageYrBlt)] = df$YearBuilt[is.na(df$GarageYrBlt)]
```


```{r}
correlationMatrix <- cor(df)
# summarize the correlation matrix
print(correlationMatrix)
# find attributes that are highly corrected (ideally >0.75)
highlyCorrelated <- findCorrelation(correlationMatrix, cutoff=0.5)
# print indexes of highly correlated attributes
print(highlyCorrelated)
```

```{r}
model.saturated = lm(SalePrice ~ ., data = df)
```

```{r}
summary(model.saturated)
```

```{r}
plot(model.saturated)
```

```{r}
influencePlot(model.saturated)

#vif(model.saturated)

avPlots(model.saturated)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
